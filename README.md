## Overview
RAMP is a bottom-up stochastic model for the generation of high-resolution multi-energy profiles, conceived for application in contexts where only rough information about users' behaviour are obtainable.

The source-code is currently released as v.0.4, the version adopted for the publication. The current v.0.4 is not yeat accompained by a detailed documentation, but the Python code is fully commented in each line to allow a complete understanding of it.

Please consider that a newer, fully commented and more user friendly version is under development and should be released soon.

The repository also hosts all the input files used to generate the profiles appearing in the abovementioned study, which may be also used as a reference example.
